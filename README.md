Spam Classification Model for SMS Messages
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). The ability to accurately identify spam messages is crucial for improving user experience and maintaining the integrity of communication channels. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project provides an efficient and scalable solution for spam detection.

Objectives -

  - Data Preparation and Preprocessing:
       Load and inspect the dataset of SMS messages.
       Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and converting text labels into a binary format.

  - Feature Extraction:
       Utilize the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert text data into numerical features that can be fed into machine learning 
       models.

  - Model Training and Evaluation:
       Train various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
       Evaluate the performance of these models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

  - Model Deployment:
      Deploy the trained model as a web service using Flask.
      Host the web service on Heroku, making the model accessible via a REST API for real-time predictions.



Implementation Steps -  
  
   - Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Load the dataset containing SMS messages and their corresponding labels.
        Clean the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
        Convert labels from categorical to numerical format (e.g., ham=0, spam=1).

    - Text Vectorization:
          Use the TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the text messages into numerical vectors that represent the importance of each word in the messages.

    - Model Training:
          Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the vectorized text data.
          Evaluate the model on a test set to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

     - Model Serialization:
          Save the trained model and the TF-IDF vectorizer using joblib for future use.
     
     - Building the Web Service:
          Create a Flask application that loads the serialized model and vectorizer.
          Define an API endpoint that accepts new SMS messages, transforms them using the TF-IDF vectorizer, and returns the prediction result (spam or ham).


     - Deploying the Web Service:
          Prepare the application for deployment by creating a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies and a Procfile to specify the command to run the app.
          Deploy the Flask application to Heroku, making it accessible via a public URL.



Features - 
      
      Accurate Spam Detection: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to classify SMS messages with high accuracy.
      Scalable Web API: The deployed model is accessible via a RESTful API, allowing for real-time predictions and easy integration into other applications.
      Cloud Deployment: Hosted on Heroku, ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of access.
      Real-time Predictions: Capable of processing and classifying new SMS messages on-the-fly.


This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and natural language processing in addressing real-world challenges, providing a robust solution for spam detection in SMS communication.
